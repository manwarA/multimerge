Multimerge

This package merges multiple dfs into one with a small number of arguments.
Apart from the arguments needed in this package, the default values from 
base::merge are used. 
The errors/warnings reported from this package are limited, as I have dependent
upon the errors/warnings from the base::merge.
 
"byCol" argument can accept the column number used for merging, however, it is not an intended functionality. 

The merge "type" argument can match the partial merge-type, which is not recommended, 
although, there are only four types available, the partial match functionality is solely for typos.
