#' Multimerge

#' This package merges multiple dfs into one with a small number of arguments.
#' Apart from the arguments needed in this package, the default values from 
#' base::merge are used. 
#' The errors/warnings reported from this package are limited, as I have dependent
#' upon the errors/warnings from the base::merge.
#' 
#' "byCol" argument can accept the column number used for merging, however, it is
#' not an intended functionality. 
#' 
#' The merge "type" argument can match the partial merge-type, which is not recommended, 
#' although, there are only four types available, the partial match functionality is 
#' solely for typos.
